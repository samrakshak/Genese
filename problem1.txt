This function is used to calculate the factorial of the number passed 
to it as a parameter.A case is given when the number is less than 1
then the factorial of that number is 1 which is returned.
Else
now as this is a recursive function it calls itself thus giving the 
factorial value. Like

fact(4)=4*fact(3)
fact(3)=3*fact(2)
fact(2)=2*fact(1)
fact(1)=1
so 
fact(4)=4*(3*(2*(1)))

def fact(n):
    
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * fact(n - 1)
-------------------------------------------

This function returns the sum of digits of n's factorial.
factorial=fact(n) from above function 
the a loop is made for every character in the factorial by converting them into string by str function then adding each number o total in a
loop and returning the value as total 

def count_digits(n):
    
    factorial = fact(n)
    total = 0
    for digit in str(factorial):
        total += int(digit)
    return total
------------------------------------------------------------
This prints the result to the screen. 

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(count_digits(100))
